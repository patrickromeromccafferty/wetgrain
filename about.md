# about 

Wet Grain is an annual print magazine for new poetry in English. Its most recent issue (Sept 2025), guest-edited by Charles Lang, Eloise Birtwhistle, & Nasim Luczaj is available now.

Since 2020, the magazine has included the work of emerging poets alongside recipients of awards including the Pulitzer, a MacArthur Fellowship, the Pushcart Prize, the German Book Prize, and the Eric Gregory. 

Each issue, selected poets are invited to contribute a short piece of commentary on a poem included in the issue. As of Issue Five, we also publish interviews and flash essays. Covers feature commissioned etchings and are hand-printed, making each copy an original print. 

The magazine was founded by Christian Lemay & [Patrick Romero McCafferty](https://patrickromeromccafferty.com/).
