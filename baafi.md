## Reader, I married him
<br>
*A golden shovel after the song ‘Midnight Train to Georgia’ by Gladys Knight & The Pips* <br>
<br>
If you asked me why I made myself so small, I’d <br>
show you the river; the one that would rather <br>
gorge itself on sewage than be clean. I’d give you a toe to live <br>
upon, a rotten tree to kneel before, a dustpan to curl up in, <br>
a name pried from a ghost. My laughter was thin, but his <br>
gave all the birds a breath to glide on. A foothold for the world. <br>
I was never that attached to me anyway. Never more than <br>
a ribbon’s stretch away from curling against a blade. I once put a live <br>
wire on my tongue to taste the void. It was not without <br>
its sweetness. That sleep – like choking on feathers, like him: <br>
the place where women went to die. Fucking me in <br>
front of the mirror, so I’d know the face beneath him was mine. <br>
<br>
<br>
