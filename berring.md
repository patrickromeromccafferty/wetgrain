## The Future Has To Be Shoved Out The Way So We Can Get Past 
<br>
<br>
It’s not that it’s heavy <br>
but it doesn’t have wheels <br>
<br>
Wouldn’t it be great to cough up <br>
not phlegm <br>
<br>
but a barrowful of snowdrops? <br>
<br>
Or a blister pack of soluble aspirin? <br>
<br>
And wouldn’t it be great to find <br>
warm pastries between your thighs <br>
<br>
freshly risen, fluffy, light <br>
<br>
(For hardly anything
<br>
is the moonlit dew <br>
or the golden sap of the pine tree <br>
<br>
Hardly anything <br>
<br>
is the sound of Japanese grasses <br>
<br>
or oxen lowing <br>
in a half acre of field) <br>
