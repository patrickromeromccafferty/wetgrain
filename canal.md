## Canal 
<br> 
<br> 
The kitchen is full of tenderness and dutch ovens,<br> 
but I do not want to look for the ladder.<br> 
<br> 
The water is so blue, the bluest <br> 
a green river can be. You cannot see <br> 
<br> 
from your half of the rising river <br> 
but my nipples show through my shirt, <br> 
<br> 
and they are magnificent. I look up <br> 
the dream meanings of canals <br> 
<br> 
but not floating in them, though <br> 
I wish I could say Iâ€™ve done it. <br> 
<br> 
Just like the mirror game, our hands <br> 
for walkie talkies. It is good, <br> 
<br> 
the connection. Sometimes a truck driver, <br> 
but usually loud and bright. We exist <br> 
<br> 
like this for a while beside the water <br> 
like two thank-you bags in a zephyr. <br> 
<br> 
There is a storm on the transmission. <br> 
I climb the ladder to put the vessels where they belong. <br> 
<br> 
<br>
