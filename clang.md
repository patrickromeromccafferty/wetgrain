## Tír na Coille Cailleannaich  
  
That candle we bought  
it smells a bit like wid,  
like stones, moss, river, mud.  
Close enough tae the notes:  
Pine, Herbal, Green Leaf.  
The finest parts ae the country  
moulded then sold in luxury soy.  
Every candle plants a tree.  
Its wick sits perfect, unlit,  
waitin fur the right moment  
tae remember how we walked  
fur miles thegither, talkin endlessly.  
I light it n picture a Caledonian forest,  
somewhere beyond the west coast.  
  
#### *Charles Lang*


Note

Charles Lang’s ‘Tír na Coille Cailleannaich’ casts an image of Scotland’s ecological consciousness   
in shrink-wrapped, scented wax. In it the longing gaze west over the Atlantic and the longing  
for a time when forests covered the land come together to decorate coffee tables, to accompany 
spider plants on windowsills. The poem’s Caledonian Forest figures as a land where dreams  
and environment take on a vapid, monocultural aroma, ’Pine, Herbal, Green Leaf.’ We join   
the speaker in lighting the wick in prayer for something more to say on intimacy and Highland Edens.
