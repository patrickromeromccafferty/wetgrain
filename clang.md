## Tír na Coille Cailleannaich  
  
That candle we bought  
it smells a bit like wid,  
like stones, moss, river, mud.  
Close enough tae the notes:  
Pine, Herbal, Green Leaf.  
The finest parts ae the country  
moulded then sold in luxury soy.  
Every candle plants a tree.  
Its wick sits perfect, unlit,  
waitin fur the right moment  
tae remember how we walked  
fur miles thegither, talkin endlessly.  
I light it n picture a Caledonian forest,  
somewhere beyond the west coast.
