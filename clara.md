## Something about foxes <br>
<br>
Their ripped curtain screams <br>
in the bin-lined night – how <br>
they open the throat’s window <br>
and for so long hold the skin <br>
over its kettle screech. One <br>
from the troop in the garden <br>
had its back leg crumpled <br>
by a motorbike or car. <br>
It’s possible I envy <br>
the extravagance of their grief. <br>
<br>
