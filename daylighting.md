## Daylighting

She has bad dreams when she moves  
into the spare room. She asks questions  
about the River Porter, maps  
  
the flat onto graph paper beneath  
her temples, she shifts the furniture.  
In Estonia her grandmother knows where  

to pitch the bedposts, how to avoid  
disturbance that shivers from deep water.  
Here red chimneys rise  

like morning, columns supporting  
memories of smoke, the Don split  
and hammered to a millrun

a museum, a forged island.  
Ear to the floor, her huddle with the boards  
returns arid. Taking a rod in each fist  

she awaits the clack  
of metal nudging metal  
the gargle of a buried vein.  

She reads Masaru Emoto  
through the streets, while fluid currents   
in her fingertips. The page turns /  

*Do it! Letâ€™s do it!*  
*turns /You make me sick, I will* Wrinkles in her  
bedlinen emerge as crooked  

ice crystals, rain persists  
at the glass behind her blind.  
She murmurs an offering, turns.  

There are rivers bound underfoot.   
Culverts of tight Victorian brick riddle  
below this concrete. A sinkhole  

opens a carpark like a shout  
a wet gaping mouth  
interrupting asphalt and white lines  

daylight cuts the exhumed water  
glancing steel off a flickering tongue.   
The rising is early this year *Out-*  

*breaks of rain push East / breach /  
remain high in response  
to recent / spread in* rainwater pushing  

against, rainwater oozing  
through masonry and this city  
is a caddisfly larva  

with its silk case of remnants  
submerged in ochres, pools of  
peat and rust.
