##Editorial <br>
<br>
If you held it in your paw would it reek of a steady curdling? Could you use it to score fresh vinyl <br>
or would its blade seek out and accentuate the old blunted grooves? Is it slick with linseed oil? <br>
If you stumbled on it in its natural habitat would its snout be rooting in the leaf litter? <br>
Rooting for what and how desperately? <br>
<br>
We didn’t set out to ask questions like these when we began this project. But the closer we came to <br>
agreeing on the poems to include in our first issue, the more we noticed the emergence of a grainy <br>
common ground, a conceptive and rooted vitality, that transmitted and mutated poetry’s genetic code <br>
with each line. Taken together then, these poems are germ, ferment, and mulch, warm with <br>
a latent and malty potential for life and growth. But they are also definite threads in themselves, <br>
strata, filigrees, blood vessels in x-ray lit with iodine, channelling and redirecting our apprehension <br>
of the world and the ideas implacably propagating within it. Like Colin Herd’s ‘pony cat’, <br>
tangentially branching its way into a cogent fluency, they prompt a kind of unstoppable <br>
bifurcation of thought, inviting the reader to shirk the good, clean, easy routes toward closure. <br>
Sometimes, like Mike Farren’s whalebone in ‘The whalebone, dreaming,’ they prefer not to move at all <br>
so that the mythical, the climatic, the imaginary all come buffeting through on ‘the salt-roughened <br>
towel of the wind.’ <br>
<br>
It’s this type of graininess, an organic, wilful agitation of experience that defines these poems <br>
in the fankle of poetry worth thinking about: they testify to poetry’s ability to incite, provoke, 
and encourage. <br>
