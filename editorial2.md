## Editorial

Open though written in confinement, conversing though written in isolation,   
the poems in this issue invert and channel the drawn-out difficulties of writing  
in lockdown, both responding to them directly and responding to them by not  
responding to them.  
  
Nasim Luczaj gives us her take in ‘Break’, when she writes: ‘i’m rested like a colour |   
observe every tremor | of a poem as it falls | off the roof | and breaks its spine.’  
Out-of-body, hyperaware, strained, the lines even titter slightly with the self-deprecating  
dark humour that I detected creeping into my own writ- ing and conversations with others  
writing poetry over the winter months. The poem itself doesn’t do this of course. If anything,   
along with the rest of the work in the issue, it’s a sure sign that poetry’s still stepping   
off rooftops, sprout- ing wings, and flapping cloudward, never mind the unaerodynamic  
conditions under which it’s been composed.  
  
Birds in flight are, unsurprisingly, the prominent living symbol that migrates   
through these pages, both as image and vocal inflection. And we’re glad to have   
it that way. When the speaker in Maria Sledmere’s ‘Evangeline’ exclaims ‘of course  
the skylarks look like skylarks,’ seemingly emerging from the textual and abstract  
into the tangible and real, I was reminded of the way my first proper encounter with  
lots of species of bird was in poetry (Elizabeth Bishop’s sandpiper, Roddy Lumsden’s   
hoopoe, Hopkins’s kingfisher) and recognising them in vivo came a much later second.  
Partly this gave them special promi- nence but it also made vocabularies available   
with which to enrich their hard and fast taxonomies.  
  
Beyond birds, the poems in the issue invite us to take our relationship to and treatment  
of non-human beings seriously, posing questions about their role in metaphor and lore as   
well as the everyday. Richard Price’s ‘The Old Woman Who Changed Herself Into A Man’ for   
example, a retelling of an Inuit folktale from The Owner of the Sea (published by Carcanet   
in June), illuminates some of the ways in which animism and gender roles within that   
traditional culture might be mutually-informing. Animals also people Arthur Allen’s elegiac   
monologue, ‘Vanishing Upon Vanishing’, in which the speaker channels their grief at the loss   
of a relative during the pandemic through descriptions of the burial of a friend’s black cat:  
‘It seems we lose someone | of extraordinary dear- ness | every four years | and only one time  
| in three is it the cat,’ prompting us to consider how the pandemic has affected our relationship  
with our pets - and indeed the notion of pet-keeping in general - as we share closer quarters  
with them over longer periods.  
  
Maybe part of what this attention to creatures that don’t overtly respond to the odes we   
write them offers is the timely opportunity to reflect on and con- front not just the ecological   
work’s constructed nature but the actual process of composition. Lots of issue two’s poems do   
this. Josh Smyth’s ‘The Moose Hunt’, for example, reads like the field notes of a poet-turned-naturalist  
in search of the Nature Poem in its urbanatural habitat, somewhere between the scrolling action   
of a thumb and a childhood memory. Meanwhile, Jack Bigglestone’s ‘A Satyr in Translation’ prises   
open some of the ways in which human sexuality and caprine physicality might be spliced and handed   
down through myth by enacting multiple simultaneous translations: animal into human, movement into   
speech, sight into sound. Sylee Gore’s Q & A poem, ‘Q. Let’s talk a bit more about that decision   
to shift away from organic materials,’ goes a step further. A portrait of the eco-artist in their   
own words, it’s a dig at the notion of celebrity within ecological art as well as the tragic need to  
make every blow of the chisel a reference to the Anthropocene. The poem’s willingness to go there and   
to laugh at its own inability to process or make good seems a constituent cadence of a wider   
environmental sensitivity.    
  
For this issue, we invited contributors to comment on a piece of our choosing, which we then   
collated into a notes section, hoping to string up some guy-ropes of light crit around a selection  
of the work we’re lucky enough to include. We passed the work around with no particular briefing    
and were warmed by the generous and wholehearted responses we got back. Our thanks to the poets   
who took this experiment on so openhandedly. Our gratitude also to all our contributors for their  
ranging, living words that go a long way to re- animating and re-embodying this digital scene we’ve   
all had a hand in keeping real since last March.
