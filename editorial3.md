Our submission window having closed in late January, these poems 
surface in a tenser, more acutely violent world than the one in which 
they were conceived and written. They now read presciently, as poetry 
will. Looking out onto their dangerous streets, we find violence in the 
image, the line and the break, with an apparentness now inevitable: <br>
<br>
the houses flank each other flank the cemetery <br>
laid out like a spiderweb we know this from <br>
the plans I know this from the satellite eye <br>
overlooking the dead <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(‘December 23rd, (Tătăraşi)’ Jeremy Allan Hawkins) <br>
<br>
Alongside representations of its effects, we find enquiries into violence’s 
essential nature. ‘The Future Has To Be Shoved Out the Way,’ Tessa 
Berring tells us, ‘So We Can Get Past.’ What is so important, the poem 
asks, that we deny ourselves that hopeful, capital ‘F’ Future? Violence, 
Berring suggests, is something we inflict on the future; the self-important 
‘We’ prioritising the present at the cost of possibility. <br>
<br>
The wish to deal with violence might be attributed to the assuredness 
the poems in this issue share, perhaps against odds. Deft arrows, they 
know where they’re going, or compel us to think so as they take us with 
them: ‘let me offer a version of yourself,’ writes Ken Cockburn in ‘Berlin 
Version,’ – ‘the local colour I’ll let you supply.’ The poem’s steering address 
validates private, imagined versions of what we go through. Rather than 
insisting on sublimation, the speakers in these poems emphasise the small
fruit yielded by our own agency – our walks and sacrifices, or the observations 
we choose to nourish. <br>
<br>
There’s a wakeful honesty in this, whether hard-won or not even a matter 
of choice. Many of the poems – Bob Beagrie’s ‘Hogtenburg,’ Desree’s 
‘On going to Anguilla to bury my Grandad,’ or Charles Lang’s ‘New Shoes,’ 
for example – take on the function of the snapshot, while others use the
specificity of the diarist - a documentary first person, dates and place names 
for titles, gesturing to a world outside themselves. In Silas Curtis’ ‘Untitled,’ 
that world encroaches on the act of writing the poem; In Jeremy Hawkins’s
‘December 23rd (Tătăraşi),’ it is waymarked by sites imbued with collective 
grief. Here and throughout, the attitude of nondeception and willingness to 
face necessity – whether material, political, or psychological – inevitably 
shines through, often to a chillingly down-to-earth effect. Still, moments 
of remarkable empathy and generosity of spirit emerge. Bartering for her life, 
the incarcerated speaker in Carine Topal’s ‘There’s Still the Fruit’ calls her 
abusive captor ‘kind, with skin much like my own; with yellow hair like 
the faraway fields I passed as father rode us out of town.’ <br>
<br>
This all to suggest that a poem might reach us as a spark, sometimes 
nosediving down to burn through our nice clothing, the sense of world 
we’ve been enveloped in; dissolving some patch of illusion we’d never 
have noticed otherwise. In Cecilia Woloch’s ‘Reign of Embers,’ a young 
terrorist screams ‘Even in your dreams, you won’t be safe,’ reminding us 
of the perenni- al need to reckon with the ideals that keep us safe while 
others suffer. The first instalments of the sequence, published in The 
American Journal of Poetry and awarded the Pushcart Prize in 2017, 
opens with an epigraph from Bertold Brecht: ‘In the dark time will there 
also be singing? Yes, there will be singing about the dark time’. The 
poems gathered here make song precisely out of the light and shade of 
our shared terrain, roaming for answers in the face of uncertainty. <br>
<br>
This search need be no contradiction to their assuredness. Some of this 
issue’s poems probe our connection to the past and the effort it takes to 
preserve that past. David Ross Linklater’s ‘Field Language’ finds 
generational forgetting in the transience of farm labour. Like mallet
blows, the linguistic labour of the recent past ‘was not nothing;’ to 
hear the past speaking to us requires a commitment to renewal and 
continuous (for- malised) restating or ‘tying the field anew to its 
boundaries.’ In Tawona Sithole’s ‘Rukweza Farmer,’ it’s actually 
the process of revision that can be harnessed to enrich the mundane 
pragmatism of the present and mobilise creativity. Pasichigare, ancestral 
wisdom, is the wildness to the present’s tameness; unconstrained, 
made so by erasure and adaptation; colouring rather than informing 
through the beauty of the music and oral storytelling that channel it. 
The idea of reworking past events is succinctly put by Tessa Berring 
in her note to Ken Cockburn’s ‘Berlin Version,’ when she writes that 
‘a poem can unpin history.’ By offering a version centered on what 
almost took place, what was wished for but not manifested in word 
or action, we find that the poem can open up new ways for relating 
it going forward. <br>
<br>
These poems make their claim on language and experience while 
keeping room for everything else that goes on outside them. Room 
can always be made in, and for, poetry. Etymology attests: ‘poetry’
 comes from making, and a ‘stanza’ is a room. A poet makes room, 
a space safe or sacred, contemplative or rupturing. Here we find it 
can be a space of play, and therefore innocent. Through the contributions 
of Hawkins, Topal, Woloch, and Alan Spence, childhood comes to 
stand for what is pliant, despite the structures of modern life: what 
is playful, innocent, fragile to corruption, rooting into these structures. 
And, as Hannah George reminds us, ‘roots can fracture concrete.’ <br>
