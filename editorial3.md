Our submission window having closed in late January, these poems <br>
surface in a tenser, more acutely violent world than the one in which <br>
they were conceived and written. They now read presciently, as poetry <br>
will. Looking out onto their dangerous streets, we find violence in the <br>
image, the line and the break, with an apparentness now inevitable: <br>
<br>
the houses flank each other flank the cemetery <br>
laid out like a spiderweb we know this from <br>
the plans I know this from the satellite eye <br>
overlooking the dead <br>
(‘December 23rd, (Tătăraşi)’ Jeremy Allan Hawkins) <br>
<br>
Alongside representations of its effects, we find enquiries into violence’s <br>
essential nature. ‘The Future Has To Be Shoved Out the Way,’ Tessa <br>
Berring tells us, ‘So We Can Get Past.’ What is so important, the poem <br>
asks, that we deny ourselves that hopeful, capital ‘F’ Future? Violence, <br>
Berring suggests, is something we inflict on the future; the self-important <br>
‘We’ prioritising the present at the cost of possibility. <br>
<br>
The wish to deal with violence might be attributed to the assuredness <br>
the poems in this issue share, perhaps against odds. Deft arrows, they <br>
know where they’re going, or compel us to think so as they take us with <br>
them: ‘let me offer a version of yourself,’ writes Ken Cockburn in ‘Berlin <br>
Version,’ – ‘the local colour I’ll let you supply.’ The poem’s steering address <br>
validates private, imagined versions of what we go through. Rather than <br>
insisting on sublimation, the speakers in these poems emphasise the small <br>
fruit yielded by our own agency – our walks and sacrifices, or the observations <br>
we choose to nourish. <br>
There’s a wakeful honesty in this, whether hard-won or not even a matter <br>
of choice. Many of the poems – Bob Beagrie’s ‘Hogtenburg,’ Desree’s <br>
‘On going to Anguilla to bury my Grandad,’ or Charles Lang’s ‘New Shoes,’ <br>
for example – take on the function of the snapshot, while others use the <br>
specificity of the diarist - a documentary first person, dates and place names <br>
for titles, gesturing to a world outside themselves. In Silas Curtis’ ‘Untitled,’ <br>
that world encroaches on the act of writing the poem; In Jeremy Hawkins’s <br>
‘December 23rd (Tătăraşi),’ it is waymarked by sites imbued with collective <br>
grief. Here and throughout, the attitude of nondeception and willingness to <br>
face necessity – whether material, political, or psychological – inevitably <br>
shines through, often to a chillingly down-to-earth effect. Still, moments <br>
of remarkable empathy and generosity of spirit emerge. Bartering for her life, <br>
the incarcerated speaker in Carine Topal’s ‘There’s Still the Fruit’ calls her <br>
abusive captor ‘kind, with skin much like my own; with yellow hair like <br>
the faraway fields I passed as father rode us out of town.’ <br>
<br>
This all to suggest that a poem might reach us as a spark, sometimes <br>
nosediving down to burn through our nice clothing, the sense of world <br>
we’ve been enveloped in; dissolving some patch of illusion we’d never <br>
have noticed otherwise. In Cecilia Woloch’s ‘Reign of Embers,’ a young <br>
terrorist screams ‘Even in your dreams, you won’t be safe,’ reminding us <br>
of the perenni- al need to reckon with the ideals that keep us safe while <br>
others suffer. The first instalments of the sequence, published in The <br>
American Journal of Poetry and awarded the Pushcart Prize in 2017, <br>
opens with an epigraph from Bertold Brecht: ‘In the dark time will there <br>
also be singing? Yes, there will be singing about the dark time’. The <br>
poems gathered here make song precisely out of the light and shade of <br>
our shared terrain, roaming for answers in the face of uncertainty. <br>
<br>
This search need be no contradiction to their assuredness. Some of this <br>
issue’s poems probe our connection to the past and the effort it takes to <br>
preserve that past. David Ross Linklater’s ‘Field Language’ finds <br>
generational forgetting in the transience of farm labour. Like mallet <br>
blows, the linguistic labour of the recent past ‘was not nothing;’ to <br>
hear the past speaking to us requires a commitment to renewal and <br>
continuous (for- malised) restating or ‘tying the field anew to its <br>
boundaries.’ In Tawona Sithole’s ‘Rukweza Farmer,’ it’s actually <br>
the process of revision that can be harnessed to enrich the mundane <br>
pragmatism of the present and mobilise creativity. Pasichigare, ancestral <br>
wisdom, is the wildness to the present’s tameness; unconstrained, <br>
made so by erasure and adaptation; colouring rather than informing <br>
through the beauty of the music and oral storytelling that channel it. <br>
The idea of reworking past events is succinctly put by Tessa Berring <br>
in her note to Ken Cockburn’s ‘Berlin Version,’ when she writes that <br>
‘a poem can unpin history.’ By offering a version centered on what <br>
almost took place, what was wished for but not manifested in word <br>
or action, we find that the poem can open up new ways for relating <br>
it going forward. <br>
<br>
These poems make their claim on language and experience while <br>
keeping room for everything else that goes on outside them. Room <br>
can always be made in, and for, poetry. Etymology attests: ‘poetry’<br>
 comes from making, and a ‘stanza’ is a room. A poet makes room, <br>
a space safe or sacred, contemplative or rupturing. Here we find it <br>
can be a space of play, and therefore innocent. Through the contributions <br> 
of Hawkins, Topal, Woloch, and Alan Spence, childhood comes to <br>
stand for what is pliant, despite the structures of modern life: what <br>
is playful, innocent, fragile to corruption, rooting into these structures. <br>
And, as Hannah George reminds us, ‘roots can fracture concrete.’ <br>
