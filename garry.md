## The View from the Cul de Sac <br>
*after SP* <br><br>
I think of someone *gloved and covered,* <br>
coming to take me away. Some kind of wildness <br>
thrums beneath my skin. Veins that pulse like <br>
a bee dance for honey. The neighbours <br>
<br>
are twitching their curtains, windows used <br>
as a magnifying glass. I used to dream about <br>
crisp white bedsheets, time and thoughtlessness, <br>
<br>
enough to do nothing but stare at my wrists <br>
until the night devoured the room. I open the windows <br>
when it rains, watch the magpie sink its beak <br>
<br>
into puddles that swirl with larvae. Summer <br>
cracks the pavement like eggshells. I close my eyes <br>
at night, and all I hear is thousands of horses <br>
running through our commuter town. <br>
<br>
