## Red Admirals <br>
<br>
I’m always taken by that meticulously cack-handed way <br> 
they hanker towards the buddleia, blundering along <br>
<br>
with such delicate abandon, as if that bush were <br>
the last place on earth you’d expect them to be going  <br>
<br>
till suddenly they’re there; each folding of intention <br>
hidden behind a coy, left-angled/right-brained trigonometry. <br>
<br>
<br>
Remember how they would cling <br>
to our garden wall for the last of the summer heat <br>
<br>
and in such numbers then, their twin hearts hinged <br>
above my long-dead father’s strawberry bed <br>
<br>
while I stood pondering what those markings <br>
spilled across their wings might mean, in this world <br>
<br>
where signs and symbols stand for everything: <br>
the black, the white, the amber and the red. <br>
