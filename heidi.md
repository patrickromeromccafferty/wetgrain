## The woman who turned to dust in the frost <br>
<br>

*‘At Norwich a young countrywoman started to cross the road <br>
in her usual robust health and was seen by the onlookers <br>
to turn visibly to powder and be blown in a puff of dust <br>
over the roofs as the icy blast struck her at the street corner.’ <br>*
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orlando, *Virginia Woolf*

what we know <br>
<br>
is that her brother was furious <br>
<br>
the children in the street carried on playing and shrieking <br>
<br>
no-one had ever heard of such an act <br>
<br>
the vicar made a note to call on her family <br>
<br>
there was less shouting and more crying in her house <br>
<br>
where they each dreamed she’d walk in again one day <br>
<br>
her husband became quietly angry at times to fill the gap <br>
<br>
what we don’t know <br>
<br>
is how she decided which clothes to wear <br>
<br>
if she went nervously out the door <br>
<br>
did she shake as she got to the turning point <br>
<br>
did she feel guilt or shame <br>
<br>
what was the rate of her heart as it happened <br>
<br>
how long the moment lasted while she was in it <br>
<br>
