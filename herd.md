## Velour Legume Serenade <br>
<br>
Wish I was being lowered <br>
a great height on a stage <br>
right now or yesterday say <br>
and reliving it right now <br>
side-saddle on a swing <br>
dangled with some sort of <br>
invisible wire system like <br>
a giant crescent moon <br>
but instead of the moon <br>
it’s a gherkin or a cashew <br>
or a carrot or a legume <br>
so dizzyingly big <br>
it just looks weird <br>
to read to you <br>
and the first line is <br>
poetry is in a shabby state <br>
and the second line is <br>
that’s how I like it <br>
the legume has to be minimum <br>
27 x the size of me <br>
I was once accused <br>
of internalising normativity <br>
and I was like <br>
Norma Tivity? <br>
Get out of here
although i did once <br>
internalise her brother <br>
Gary he was nice <br>
he didn’t exist <br>
you knew that already
you were just playing along do legumes have dimples?
Maybe we need a retractable spike to avoid getting too comfortable in the rut
it would be ace if the material was velour a velour legume when I said get out of here
it was a joke
I didn’t mean it
behind me + legume
the walls suddenly
open little trapdoors and
six tongues come out
flapping to the tune of
“Don’t leave
I didn’t mean it
The show is about to begin”
I would like a jacket
made out of the skins
of kiwi fruits
but it seems cruel
maybe a vest?
if I work on my abs
hi Norma
didn’t expect to see you here
say hi to Gary for me
I have this gift for the serenade
where I can read in front of an audience without a book in my hands
I got taught it by a spoken word
artist
love you all
it’s important here
for this poem
because the book
or the piece of paper would get in the way
of me saying
what I want to say
which is
oh hoist me up
hedonist engineers
of yore
whisk me away
whisk me back up
hoist & whisk
in one motion if you can in the dimple of my legume covered
in velour
sweeties twist your hips and hoist and whisk that’s it that’s the motion darlings darlings darlings whisk & hoist me away on my velour legume
I love you
