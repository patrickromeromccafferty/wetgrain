## Velour Legume Serenade <br>
<br>
Wish I was being lowered <br>
a great height on a stage <br>
right now or yesterday say <br>
and reliving it right now <br>
side-saddle on a swing <br>
dangled with some sort of <br>
invisible wire system like <br>
a giant crescent moon <br>
but instead of the moon <br>
it’s a gherkin or a cashew <br>
or a carrot or a legume <br>
so dizzyingly big <br>
it just looks weird <br>
to read to you <br>
and the first line is <br>
poetry is in a shabby state <br>
and the second line is <br>
that’s how I like it <br>
the legume has to be minimum <br>
27 x the size of me <br>
I was once accused <br>
of internalising normativity <br>
and I was like <br>
Norma Tivity? <br>
Get out of here <br>
although i did once <br>
internalise her brother <br>
Gary he was nice <br>
he didn’t exist <br>
you knew that already <br>
you were just playing along <br>
do legumes have dimples? <br>
Maybe we need a retractable <br>
spike to avoid getting too <br>
comfortable in the rut <br>
it would be ace if the material <br>
was velour a velour legume <br>
when I said get out of here <br>
it was a joke <br>
I didn’t mean it <br>
behind me + legume <br>
the walls suddenly <br>
open little trapdoors and <br>
six tongues come out <br>
flapping to the tune of <br>
“Don’t leave <br>
I didn’t mean it <br>
The show is about to begin” <br>
I would like a jacket <br>
made out of the skins <br>
of kiwi fruits <br>
but it seems cruel   <br>
maybe a vest?  <br>
if I work on my abs  <br>
hi Norma  <br>
didn’t expect to see you here  <br>
say hi to Gary for me  <br>
I have this gift for the serenade  <br>
where I can read in front of an audience  <br> 
without a book in my hands  <br>
I got taught it by a spoken word  <br>
artist  <br>
love you all  <br>
it’s important here  <br>
for this poem  <br>
because the book  <br>
or the piece of paper  <br>
would get in the way  <br>
of me saying  <br>
what I want to say  <br>
which is  <br>
oh hoist me up  <br>
hedonist engineers  <br>
of yore  <br>
whisk me away  <br>
whisk me back up  <br>
hoist & whisk  <br>
in one motion if you can  <br>
in the dimple of my   <br>
legume covered  <br>
in velour  <br>
sweeties twist your hips  <br>
and hoist and whisk  <br>
that’s it that’s the motion  <br>
darlings darlings darlings  <br>
whisk & hoist me away  <br>
on my velour legume  <br>
I love you <br>
 <br>
  <br>
