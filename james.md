## Light Revisions  
<br>
<br>

Don’t worry. This isn’t the beginning. I know <br>
you, I know how you worry about all that is <br>
to come and so do I, and that’s fine. This has, <br>
<br>
at least, been written now, the page turned to <br>
maybe once or twice before, these little letters all <br>
shaped on someone’s tongue. Aren’t colours <br>
<br>
really light revised in the eye? All these years <br>
you’ve been buried in your life, whittled roots <br>
into woodwork, set windows in walls, and all <br>
<br>
the while thoughts scuffle in the skirting board. <br>
Yours is a familial place, though no one else <br>
has dug into this moment before. But familiar <br>
<br>
to you as your mother’s elbows, grandfather <br>
clock, heirloom tomatoes. All these blue hours <br>
spent pacing the hall as if it were a throat, <br>
<br>
scrubbing the old floorboards down to dirt, <br>
scouring your hands thin just for some sound, <br>
vowelless, fricative – Shh. Don’t be afraid. <br>
<br>
You’ve known far too long what it is to love <br>
a closed door. And how to knock. It’s time <br>
you did some speaking. There’s a sea out there <br>
<br>
calling for its name. Don’t worry about me. <br>
What’s left is just revision, just working out <br>
the pitch, like a gull hones sharp the angle <br>
<br>
of the plunge beneath the wing. Shorelines amending <br>
themselves to the tide. Or, the way each line lies <br>
flat upon the last (this is not the last), each life <br>
<br>
accounts for its loss, each word cradles its <br>
extinct species. Or, more like how the last time <br>
you left, I knew where to meet you. <br>
<br>
