## Birch Wintering
<br>
I strip me bare wear wind <br> 
around my scaly skin leaf-lost <br>
bark crack flake back amidst <br>
my kind parade grove-proud <br>
we crowd all I<br>
<br>
I sleep so long dream-throng <br>
in dark days and my long night <br>
bone-truth gone around again <br>
lie low as sky can only think <br>
not die shall I<br>
<br>
I peer through haar and hail <br>
plot passage as clock hands <br>
times turn in cold gold dawn<br>
and silent gloam life homes<br>
so survive I<br>
<br>
I wait it out the long fetch <br>
and reach of light await as <br>
days stretch until warm come <br>
until bud plump and bloom <br>
for shall thrive I <br>
<br>
