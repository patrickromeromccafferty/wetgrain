## a lazy clairvoyant predicts her own future with her phone’s autocomplete


my future is going well thanks  
I really hope I haven’t made you  
disappear  
  
my future is going to be  
full of summer moments I didn’t get  
around to 
  
my future is going to be treated  
as the winner  
when we touch the wolf  
  
I have a poem in which I use the words wolf  
it down into our satchels and pretend  
it isn’t there  
  
I have a summer  
I have a poem  
I think you should meet  
  
I have a poem in which I use the words   
I have a future  
I already know   
  
my future is more than a distant relative   
my future is moon between us  
and the orb  
  
tonight the clairvoyant is missing  
a little detail  
from the last two years  
  
the other world is born  
out of nothing  
the poem is very enthusiastic about it all

Note

Laura Theis, ‘a lazy clairvoyant predicts her own future with her phone’s autocomplete’  
For a poem at least nominally about prediction, ‘a lazy clairvoyant’ is strangely static:  
the repeating, interweaving lines; the push-pull of tenses and perspectives   
(‘I have a future/I already know’); the fractured sentences that seem to trail off into silence.  
It’s as if splitting past from future is an impossible task. Tomorrow’s technologies (GTP-4,  
Bing-AI) have their predecessors in the predictive text of 12-key Nokia handsets, and once  
advanced text-generators are outdated by the day. In Theis’s poem, the forked paths of autocomplete  
lead back onto themselves in a monologic maze. The future talks in circles: a fragile feedback  
loop that quite literally takes the words right out of our mouths. By the end,   
‘the poem is very enthusiastic about it all,’ the poet nowhere to be seen.
