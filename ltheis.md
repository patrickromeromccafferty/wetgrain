### a lazy clairvoyant predicts her own future with her phone’s autocomplete

my future is going well thanks  
I really hope I haven’t made you  
disappear  
  
my future is going to be  
full of summer moments I didn’t get  
around to 
  
my future is going to be treated  
as the winner  
when we touch the wolf  
  
I have a poem in which I use the words wolf  
it down into our satchels and pretend  
it isn’t there  
  
I have a summer  
I have a poem  
I think you should meet  
  
I have a poem in which I use the words   
I have a future  
I already know   
  
my future is more than a distant relative   
my future is moon between us  
and the orb  
  
tonight the clairvoyant is missing  
a little detail  
from the last two years  
  
the other world is born  
out of nothing  
the poem is very enthusiastic about it all
