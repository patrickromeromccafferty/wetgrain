## Story of the Letter M <br>
<br>
With a prophet’s moustache and a penchant for conspiracy <br>
the madman explains to me that language is a form of mind control <br>
the grammar itself holding our hands in a mudra <br>
with an incantation muttered over millennia by our mothers, <br>
shaping our thoughts <br>
<br>
I want to master the art of the pictogram, he says, <br>
as this earliest form of writing <br>
is uncontaminated by the misers, the drive for accumulation <br>
manufactured with the rise of agriculture <br>
<br>
the letter M, for example, originates from the pictogram of a wave <br>
we forget where it comes from, it loses all meaning <br>
we write it over and over without ever thinking of water <br>
or how mar y mother, <br>
muro y morada, <br>
music and moon, <br>
mareo y marea are of one essence. <br>
<br>
As he speaks, I watch the surfers <br>
gliding along the lip of the perfect breakers <br>
almost for the whole line of the horizon <br>
before they topple over into the sea <br>
like tiny plastic soldiers. <br>
<br>
That night we slept hearing the waves crash onto the rocks <br>
and in the morning, we knew we were rocks too. <br>
Our hearts, hardened lava. <br>
<br>
The Pacific had smoothed round windows through us <br>
and like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture <br>
we were made whole <br>
by what we lack <br>
<br>
