## Mausoleum <br>
*Tomb of the Quadriga, Vatican Necropolis* <br>
<br>
Not quite an absence of birds – there are painted birds <br>
perched in the fresco rafters; peacocks and something <br>
like a dove preen themselves in the white air. <br>
They stand for mourning and the everlastingness <br>
<br>
of things. You know the Romans persisted in feeding <br>
their dead while they waited for forever? <br>
Honey and bread and the best Falernian wine. <br>
In the scalloped niche two urns unbroken, their flanks <br>
<br>
touching as they would have touched in life. A faded <br>
wedge of blue for want of sky and underfoot, <br>
because the dead have always somewhere else to be, <br>
a four-horse chariot led forth by a ghost or a god; <br>
<br>
the roadway strewn with olive branches and black <br>
flowers, whose petals turn from petals into stones. <br>
<br>
<br>
