## Ajar
<br>
i think a flower has crept out <br>
of my body, outlived it. <br>
softness stitches that slit <br>
rolling moon down my shoulder. <br>
roll a little longer, i implore <br>
with the zeal of a water curtain <br>
blurted endlessly out of a rock. <br>
to relax: to be well-placed bloom. <br>
from here life as a whole <br>
might have been a stone <br>
trained to tell flesh where to go. <br>
mouths stagger above the bowl. <br>
in the end it can be comforting for fruit <br>
to replace fruit. hug me hug me <br>
the leashed light keeps barking. <br>
<br>
