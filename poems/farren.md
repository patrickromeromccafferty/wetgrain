## The whalebone, dreaming 
<br>
*Skiba Geo, Birsay, Orkney* <br>
<br>
You dream of sitting on the low cliff-top <br>
of the island, soaked by sea squalls, dried <br>
in the salt-roughened towel of the wind. <br>
You want to observe the sea-birds dive <br>
and emerge with a beakful of silver; <br>
watch the wave crests cleft by the fin <br>
of the basking shark; see the seals <br>
as they wallow on rocks and leave <br>
their skins behind on a full-moon night. <br>
You long for the trawlerman’s toil; the patience <br>
of those who fish alone; the distant <br>
mystery of the tanker on the horizon. <br>
You yearn for the hopeful landfall of settlers, <br>
with sacks of seed and breeding stock; the invaders’ <br>
black sails and berserk bellowed cry; <br>
the ramshackle craft of refugees; <br>
and the everyday of cargo ship and ferry. <br>
You wish to watch the sun rise from and slip into <br>
the sea a hundred billion times; to feel <br>
the island ride on tides of magma; sense <br>
it shear away from the continent of all; <br>
feel the slow inexorability of its clash <br>
with another mass of land; rise up <br>
with the mountain chain in the crumple zone <br>
beneath your feet; be ground by glacier and <br>
the drop-on-drop erosion of water and weather <br>
that washes your metamorphic form to sand. <br>
<br>
