## There Are Multiple Photos of Hermit Crabs with Doll Heads for Shells
<br>
I hold the world with gloves of Elmer’s glue. <br>
When dried, it makes things smooth enough to touch. <br>
At night you peel it off of me in flakes <br>
revealing patch by patch my newborn skin, <br>
a wrinkled mammal squealing desire’s <br>
most basic alphabet. And this is how <br>
I sound to you, without the extra noise <br>
of loose threads cluttering my seams. You trace <br>
my name along the junctions of my nerves; <br>
the accent makes it yours, a trapdoor name <br>
I fall into, relieved to be offstage. <br>
You hold me in the dark. The buzz of steps <br>
above us tunnels in my fingertips. <br>
The world you put inside me lifts its nose, <br>
begins to clean its face with tongue-soaked paws. <br>
Across my palms, my open lifelines itch. <br>
<br>
