## White Noise <br>
<br>
There’s a western on somewhere <br>
and the work is easy. It makes me <br>
<br>
an indoor person. I thin the coffee <br>
with new water and doubt myself. <br>
<br>
All at once a business of horses <br>
hold their hooves over my mouth <br>
<br>
so the voice in my head barely manages <br>
a sideward glance, a false gossip, <br>
<br>
like who’s going to read this <br>
and weep. Out of nowhere <br>
<br>
a thousand pages of gunfire– <br>
who do I know that loves <br>
<br>
violence in the afternoon? <br>
I hear the credits rolling,<br>
<br>
the song that accompanies sun <br>
on it’s way to somewhere better. <br>
<br>
Shortly after, the tapes switch <br>
and the sun makes its gallant return. <br>
<br>
<br>
