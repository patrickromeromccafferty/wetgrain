## dogworld <br>
<br>
<br>
like a dog <br>
tied to a bollard <br>
is an island <br>
<br>
tongue lapping <br>
at the shores <br>
of its world <br>
<br>
our world <br>
presses sky <br>
into void <br>
<br>
sunlight<br>
nestled in cloud <br>
drifts into space <br>

& like dogs <br>
we plant our chins <br>
and wait <br>

watching cars <br>
coast by pavements <br>
spilling clouds <br>
<br>
into a big blue sky <br>
breaking at the shore <br>
of a vacuum <br>
<br>
<br>
