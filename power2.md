## Sunny side <br>
<br>
I spent the weekend walking around in bed <br>
until the birds stopped their alarms <br>
and sky’s wet clouds folded like an omelette. <br>
<br>
I struggle to get invested in the middle of the day, <br>
when the pans soak like eggshells <br>
and the wind stops still in the bloated curtain net. <br>
<br>
