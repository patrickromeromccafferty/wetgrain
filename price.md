## The Old Woman Who Changed Herself into a Man
### *from 'The Owner of the Sea: Three Inuit Stories Retold'*
<br>
<br>

*Winter*
<br>
It’s the season the families move on from us. <br>
There are no caribou here in winter. <br>
They leave us, an old woman and a young woman, <br>
knowing there is little to live on this far from the world.<br>
<br>
<br>

*Stone house* <br>
<br>
<br>
Ours is a stone house so perhaps the first people made it. <br>
<br>
<br>

*Question*

<br>
Is it right for a woman to sew the hide of a caribou, <br>
but wrong to spear one?<br>
<br>
Is it right for a woman to butcher a seal, <br>
but wrong to harpoon one?<br>
<br>
Is it right for a woman to cook a char, <br>
but wrong to hook it?<br>
<br>
There are fewer rules here<br>
when the hunting families have moved on.<br>
<br>
<br>

*‘Adopted Daughter’* <br>
<br>
I am a very old woman now.<br>
<br>
I was ‘quite old’ when she came to me. She was an orphan.<br>
<br>
They call her my adopted daughter, and the term is useful enough.<br>
<br>
<br>

*Transformed* <br>
<br>
I will marry the girl, I will be a man.<br>
<br>
I cut off my toes and they sniff and bark. <br>
They wag their tails, they are my dogs.<br>
<br>
I cut off my right nipple and it’s sharp, a spear.<br>
<br>
I cut off my left nipple and it’s sharp too, a harpoon.<br>
<br>
I make a harpoon rope from the hair on my head, <br>
fishing line from the finer hairs lower down.<br>
<br>
I cut out the place between my legs and I have the sledge we need. <br>
<br>
I am a man, ready to hunt, ready to marry.<br>
<br>
<br>

*Learning* <br>
<br>
My husband caught her first seal at the lampside. <br>
It smelt strongly of pee so she gave it to the dogs.<br>
<br>
Even they thought twice about it. And they used to be toes! <br>
<br>
I went to bed with my husband, hungry.
<br>
My husband caught his second seal at the doorway.<br>
It smelt almost as bad as the first one so she gave it to the dogs.<br>
<br>
They ate it quickly, though they grumbled about it. <br>
<br>
I went to bed with my husband, hungry.<br>
<br>
My husband caught his third seal at the porch. <br>
It didn’t smell so bad but we couldn’t stomach it.<br>
<br>
The dogs fought over it.<br>
<br>
I went to bed with my husband, nigh on starving.<br>
<br>
The fourth seal was caught on the ground-ice <br>
and it was good meat.<br>
<br>
I don’t know why we couldn’t eat it.<br>
<br>
The dogs shared it among themselves.<br>
Though we went to our bed empty we felt optimistic.<br>
<br>
My husband caught his fifth seal way out on the sea-ice. <br>
<br>
He got there thanks to his dogs and his sledge.<br>
<br>
The meat was good and to be honest that way of hunting <br>
set the pattern for our whole way of life.<br>
<br>
<br>

*Arrival* <br>
<br>
She was a man now <br>
and that explains my baby. <br>
<br>
<br>

*More Questions* <br>
<br>
Sometimes my husband <br>
would hunt without the sledge and dogs. <br>
<br>
It was Spring and our stone house <br>
had its first visitor while my husband was away. <br>
<br>
“Whose dogs are these?” the man asked, <br>
knowing they couldn’t be mine. <br>
<br>
“My foster mother’s,” I said, plainly. <br>
<br>
“Whose sledge is this?” the man asked, <br>
giving me a look I didn’t want to return. <br>
<br>
“My foster mother’s,” I said.
<br>
“Who has caught these seals?” <br>
“I think you know who.” <br>
<br>
<br>

*Confession* <br>
<br>
I told him our history.<br>
<br>
I had just finished when the dogs outside started kicking up a fuss. <br>
<br>
A man’s voice greeted them, my husband’s, <br>
but I knew another change was taking place. <br>
<br>
<br>

*Return* <br>
<br>
I am an old woman again. <br>
At the house door I saw my wife had a visitor. <br>
I saw there was a man inside the stone house. <br>
I was ashamed and I was frail again, an old woman. <br>
Help, I called out to my daughter, Help. <br>
<br>
She came to me and led me in. <br>
The visitor greeted me respectfully but did not linger. <br>
He is the reason you and everyone else knows our story. <br>
<br>
