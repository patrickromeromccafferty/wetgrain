## One Tree Hill
<br>
<br>
Doesn’t it stink British that my friend said <br>
It’s OK if we die because we know how<br>
<br>
we feel about each other – even if one of us <br>
is dead, at least the other won’t be<br>
<br>
sleepless over unsaid love. I agreed <br>
and by doing so confirmed that we did<br>
<br>
indeed know how we felt. This took place <br>
in another time. Now we’re in a high school<br>
<br>
teen drama and I am a shaken bottle sending <br>
its lid to the sky. A park bench is framed<br>
<br>
with blossoms. Magic hankies balloon out <br>
of our mouths – sorry, thank you, sorry,<br>
<br>
thank you. Three stretched episodes of missing <br>
each other’s calls but at last we’re giving<br>
<br>
our viewers what they want. The script says <br>
they hug with significance and now I’m worried.<br>
<br>
If only I could hear the soundtrack. Anyone<br>
in this business knows that nothing good comes<br>
<br>
after an embrace like that. The sky looks <br>
unsure of itself and were it up to me,<br>
<br>
we would walk the same way home, but I <br>
don’t have that kind of power on these sets.<br>
<br>
