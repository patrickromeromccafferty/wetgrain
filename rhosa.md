## Summer <br>
<br>
I want to be where nectar <br>
melts on the tongue like fools <br>
<br>
don your summer colours <br>
& stretch into god-drenched fields <br>
<br>
chroma light harmonics <br>
bee breath, cardamom intelligence <br>
<br>
crush me into finer pollens <br>
so I can seed this overdue obituary <br>
<br>
sunflowers in summer drift <br>
bow again and again into love. <br>
<br>
<br>
