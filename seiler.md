## pitch & glint 
<br>
<br>
the thing which blew at us from large, inhabited trees <br>
was at home deep <br>
in the time of conversations, tree talk <br>
was tree cake and lay <br>
heavy at home, like a bone at rest that had <br>
as we kids often shouted been on its way <br>
before your time, it had stridden across the fields <br>
<br>
and breathed on them, and we had <br>
long and happily known to praise it, we saw <br>
that even our father loved it, called it <br>
a memory prop, his heart’s <br>
signal box and the seed stock <br>
of footsteps barely taken now, of crawler <br>
vehicles, of ores and oils, broken from <br>
<br>
his walking quarters, far beyond <br>
the Culmitzsch dams, torn far from <br>
a strange job near Selingstädt <br>
with the Russian ores, their oils. and although <br>
we should have long been asleep <br>
we’d crowd down to mother, when father <br>
went about at night and roared <br>
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bone the white was the bones </em> <br> 
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Russian oils and ores </em> <br>
as we said to ourselves, he smells the ore, it’s the bone, yes <br>
<br>
he’d climbed the spoilheaps <br>
known the mines, the caterpillar tracks, the water, the schnapps <br>
and so slid homewards, discoverer of the overburden, <br>
we hear it ticking, it’s the clock, it’s <br>
his Geiger counter heart <br>
<br>
