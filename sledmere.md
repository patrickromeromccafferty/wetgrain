## Whirl Piece <br>
*for Lindsay* <br>
<br>
Pouring our eyes into the barf device <br>
Stars are reciting their wanton errors <br>
<br>
So much world is craquelure and rumour <br>
Deducted from the moneyed dimension <br>
<br>
Starting to feel a personal moltenness <br>
Ineluctably drawn to the hot tub <br>
<br>
Which is our holy watering <br>
Much like a kissing slang <br>
<br>
Of tripping into the placeless <br>
Scrying material of our diaries <br>
<br>
I remember sweet bay magnolia, <br>
American sycamore, Valley oak <br>
<br>
Dancing asteroids into the distance <br>
We’d buckled our lungs to <br>
<br>
More than work, a knife, breaking fasts <br>
With tacos and the sun peach <br>
<br>
Brandished in lieu of ornament’s <br>
Brilliant granite sampled from Yuba <br>
<br>
What to hold as we are in pieces, held <br>
Viridian bath light by the same dream <br>
<br>
Goddessing its way to our boyfriends <br>
Coming in waves until we sharpen <br>
<br>
