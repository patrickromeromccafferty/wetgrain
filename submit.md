​
General Guidelines:

Please send **up to five pages of poetry** as a .doc or .docx via email <br> to submissions [at] wetgrainpoetry.co.uk with your name in the title of the document. If your work is visual or contains formatting these formats don't accommodate, feel free to send a pdf. <br><br>
Essay submissions should not exceed 3000 words. Again, please send us your essay in an editable document. 
We welcome submissions in translation provided permission has been obtained to publish the original. <br><br>
We no longer accept simultaneous submissions.<br><br>
If you haven’t already, we encourage prospective contributors to familiarise themselves with the poetry we publish by buying a copy of [a previous issue](shop.md). <br><br>
We also consider **pitches of essays, interviews, and ** and will occassionally publish **reviews of recent collections**. If you are sending us a pitch please outline why you think it would be a good fit for the magazine in your cover letter along with a sample of your prose. <br><br>
We encourage and actively seek work by poets from underrepresented and marginalised backgrounds. <br><br>
We pay **£75** per poem, & **£100** per thousand words of prose upon publication. <br><br>
