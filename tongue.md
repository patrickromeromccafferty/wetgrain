## Inchkeith Hypothesis
*‘Some sayis they spak goode hebrew bot as to myself I knaw not bot <br>
be the authoris reherse.’* <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Lyndsay of Pitscottie, 1493 <br>
<br>
‘It is more likely they would scream like their dumb nurse, or bleat <br>
like the goats or sheep on the island.’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The History of Scotland, Sir Walter Scott <br>
<br>
Forgive me, my love, if I sometimes think of abandoning you here <br>
to the great experiment of language; how unsayable, unsullied, a pure soul, <br>
you might be chosen to give us God’s utterance, here, where aleph and beth  <br>
already hum inside rock and turf, sea pinks crushed putty in your original mouth. <br>
The gulls’ guttural screech, of course. And the rise and fall of the tidal breeze  <br>
through your lungs. All worldly things must be placed on your blabber-tongue  <br>
before a name is given. I get that. Yet how we obsess over you living an Eden  <br>
where animals are as yet unnamed and the world is new again <br>
or not at all. The fears stay old and blown. Your still small voice is still small. <br>
I hear you say mmaa mmaa in need. Here is a bunker; here is a pillbox. <br>
As if conception could be paused on the lip, just there, a moment <br>
before meanings thump their way in like distant naval guns. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, instead, how about I stay with you, <br>
the three bridges our nightlights, the automated lighthouse a beacon by which to pull yourself <br>
to standing, and I’ll listen. I’ll keep eye contact for as long as it takes. <br>
We can never land on the same island twice. Teach me that nothing is proven. <br>
And isn’t it incredible that we can keep it together, for a time, here, <br>
even when it is not the Lord’s voice that rings forth from under your tongue’s guddle <br>
but the splat of wrack in the emptying pools, and the slubbery bubble <br>
of the tides going out across the lugworms’ casts in their playful salty bath. <br>
Let’s slap our flat palms into this warm broth, tumble on our backs, <br>
and belly-giggle it all out until we’re rescued. <br>
<br>
<br>
