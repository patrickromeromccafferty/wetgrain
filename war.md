## Before the War  

  
Somewhere in May falls
this same drizzle. The same sky

shrouds a city I loved  
enough to let it go  

barely looking back
I return on occasion. To stare  

you learn against your will, over time  
all faces vanish away  

behind a window. Hands  
twitch or thin they  

touch in May or now  
what is not there  

utters your name, tentatively  
fingerprints spell

pieces of dirt on the glass  
block the sight of waterdrops.  

Once upon a time there was a deadless city  
in that city I forage your voice  

the two legs of desire crawled  
on old yellow tiles  

One noon I was about to fall down  
fainting under the weight of a wing  

destruction had already begun, animals  
howled as instants before the earthquake  

we confused our desire to love with panic
for the future came that whiff of the moribund.  

Meanwhile we walked, meanwhile  
we went through the darkness as if it was our right  

we dodged the rain in dilapidated rooms  
we counted the seconds left to enter  

in reality faces are always cruder  
gestures less sharp  

a hand waving in the air is not a goodbye it is  
a blow

that did not happen, a blow  

suspended in the sky unseals the scar.  
Nobody knows if they will survive, nobody  

knows if they will spend years in silence, crouching  
the pavement awaits the drops motionless, this rain  

this identical zinc sky. The alloy  
takes place, a face swaps itself into the distance.  

When I was complete, something says.   
Before the war, someone or something  

says: before losing what I was destined  
to lose  

somewhere in May, before  
shrinkage and before subtraction  

ruins looked delicate. Never  
have I known what name to give  

to those who lose a sister. Are they  
orphans are they bereaved are they injured?  

Antigone claimed this was the irrevocable  
loss. Before laceration  

this sky occurs, perpetually  
the same drizzle dangles from your hair  

or mine  

how strange it has been to grow old without  
imagining a leaf alight on your shoulders  

without graves without cavities the city   
open your mouth, swallow  

your own words what you said:  
immortality lasted so little.
