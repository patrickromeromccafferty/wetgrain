## When This Night Comes
<br>
<br>
We have already touched upon it – coda to this life <br>
Half-wolf of gold and balm, fevered ibis scribe beside <br>
<br>
The humid nightblue heart weighed white as a feather <br>
Our souls, born slow and dark, still rivered by a tether <br>
<br>
There are only two truths: we were all – and nothing <br>
That mirage, late in the distance; sense it swiftly coming <br>
<br>
Give me this one night, the swallow and the dove <br>
Bird after bird wheeling in the tenuous sky above <br>
<br>
The wind is sweeter now for being eager at our heels <br>
But for you, I’d know not what the heart is, what it feels <br>
<br>
My sable silver’d love: we embrace, we will not sleep <br>
Although my soul walks with me, it is yours to keep <br>
<br>
There all the time within you and ever shall be <br>
Shut your eyes and see, and touch – touch me <br>
<br>
<br>
