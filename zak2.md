## Nocturne as Running White Deer <br>
<br>
The deer appear, frozen at the edge <br>
of the forest, or the frame, of mind <br>
electric with night and the absence <br>
of silver fence or unimpeded gaze. <br>
<br>
<br>

<span style="color: grey;">Light exists but only as memory.</span>

<br>
<br>
The blur of motion, the spectres <br>
of trees, the image inverted on <br>
the far side of the eye, the ratio <br>
of hindquarters marbled to torso. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: grey;">Space exists but only as negative.</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
They run, for fear of what follows. <br>
It is spring, and down in the valley, <br>
colours lie in wait like landmines, <br>
quiet grenades across the grass. <br>
<br>
<br>
